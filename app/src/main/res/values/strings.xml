    <string name="restaurant_three_phone">Phone: 212 233-0507</string>
    <string name="restaurant_three_address">Address: 145 W Broadway, Mumbai</string>
    <string name="restaurant_three_overview">Overview: The Odeon is a New York City classic. This restaurant has been around since 1980, long before these Tribeca streets became lined with Vespas and well-dressed children. We weren’t around back in those days, so we’re not going to be the ones to give you a detailed history of the place.

Let’s just say...we missed all the good stuff.</string>

    <string name="restaurant_four_name">Carbone</string>
    <string name="restaurant_four_phone">Phone: 212 254-3000</string>
    <string name="restaurant_four_address">Address: 181 Thompson St, Mumbai</string>
    <string name="restaurant_four_overview">Overview: Carbone is an Italian-American restaurant created by Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi and Jeff Zalaznick. The restaurant pays homage to the essence of the great Italian-American restaurants of mid-20th century in New York, where delicious, exceptionally well-prepared food was served in settings that were simultaneously elegant, comfortable and unpretentious. The food nods to that same history, but takes its culinary cues from the great talents and techniques of the present and of the future. Familiar dishes like Seafood Salad, Linguini Vongole, Lobster Fra Diavola, Chicken Scarpariello and Veal Parmesan elevated to a new level.</string>

    <string name="restaurant_five_phone">Phone: 646 954-1231</string>
    <string name="restaurant_five_address">Address: 142 Orchard St, Mumbai</string>
    <string name="restaurant_five_overview">Overview: Natural wines and thoughtful, innovative food that feels effortless and always fresh are the staples of WildAir, the sister restaurants to its highly-acclaimed sister restaurant, Contra, located just a couple of doors down. Each dish here is more than it seems from the menu listings: lettuce, for example, is not something one should feel compelled to order off a roster that boasts an impressive list of proteins and interesting flavor profiles. But here, that lettuce is so much more than just lettuce. It is Little Gems coated with ribbons of butter and lettuce dressing (a play on butter lettuce, we presume) and topped with crunchy topped pistachios. The beef options on offer the Wagyu steak and the beef tartare served with sharp cheddar and horseradish–are smart follow ups to the salad you should not underestimate. If you are in the mood for fish, the squid is a winner, as is the scallop crudo, if there is shrimp on the menu, order them they are expertly sourced and could stand on their own when it comes to delicious, fresh from the sea flavor. While this restaurant is all about catching up with friends in a wine bar style environment, you wont feel rushed out. This is the kind of place you will want to take your time in, sipping a weird wine you just discovered–thanks to their curated list.</string>

The Grill, a reinvented chophouse boasts a simple menu of classics redefined.

    <string name="hotel_four_address">Address: 80 Columbus Cir,  Mumbai, NY 10023, United States</string>

Another great attraction is The Pembroke Room which has been designed with a kind of old-world charm, with plush carpeted floors, and a general vibe that is sure to speak to the inner romantic in all of us.
